## About

Learning about & applying algorithms and data structures for generative
art/design, helping to introduce participants to a wider spectrum of techniques.

Unlike other initiatives like
[#genuary](https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary?src=hashtag_click&f=live),
[#codevember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codevember?src=hashtag_click&f=live),
[#nodevember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nodevember?src=hashtag_click&f=live)
etc., all of which are predominantly using visual/conceptual prompts, the focus
of initiative is on algorithmic literacy, using technical, algorithmic prompts
(of course, with some [visual] references and study materials) without further
prescribing how these algorithms should be used. The only aim, goal and hope is
for people to **creatively engage** with these techniques, breaking 'em, hacking
'em and finding interesting uses to create outcomes, which could be considered
artistic. Algorithmic layering is encouraged at each turn!

In some sense, this more "bottom-up" approach to creation is maybe alien to
some, but it has the potential to produce a much wider scope of outcomes
(hopefully not only visual - audio, text and other outputs are highly
encouraged!). There's also hope it _could_ be more educational, helping people
to engage with a larger repertoire of fundamental algorithmic tools and then
apply & mix them in their own work/practice.

Many of the topics & algorithms selected here will have a more or less known
visual representation and we encourage everyone to consciously reject these
clichés and make honest attempts to find creative other solutions to
visualize/sonify/represent them.

## (Incomplete) List of topics

These will still have to be properly ordered and turned into actual daily
prompts with linked references/materials. In no particular order or importance
(yet), currently merely a brain dump:

1) Non-uniform random distributions
    - Gaussian/normal, geometric, exponential...
    - Poisson disc sampling
    - Density fields
1) Colored noise
    - red, blue, pink, brown, green...
1) Low discrepancy sequences
    - Halton, Kronecker, Plastic number
1) Metrics & dissimilarities
    - Manhattan, Chebyshev, Haversine, Hamming, Canberra, Minkowski...
    - Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, Sørensen–Dice...
1) Trees
    - Spatial indexing: Quad/Oct/Kd-trees
    - Sparse Voxel trees
    - Abstract syntax trees (e.g. S-expressions)
1) Graphs
    - Directed vs. undirected
    - Adjacency matrix/list
    - Clusters
1) Disjoint Sets
    - Unionfind (e.g. blob detection/labeling)
    - Mazes
1) Minimum Spanning Tree
    - Kruskal
1) Paths
    - Shortest paths, Dijkstra...
    - Hamiltonian
1) Convolution
    - Kernels
    - Cellular automata
    - Audio (1D), Image (2D), Volume (3D) filtering

# AlgoApril

## About

Learning about & applying algorithms and data structures for generative
art/design, helping to introduce participants to a wider spectrum of techniques.

Unlike other initiatives like
[#genuary](https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary?src=hashtag_click&f=live),
[#codevember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codevember?src=hashtag_click&f=live),
[#nodevember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nodevember?src=hashtag_click&f=live)
etc., all of which are predominantly using visual/conceptual prompts, the focus
of the `#AlgoApril` initiative is on algorithmic literacy, using technical,
algorithmic prompts (of course, with some [visual] references and study
materials) without further prescribing how these algorithms should be used. The
only aim, goal and hope is for people to **creatively engage** with these
techniques, breaking 'em, hacking 'em and finding interesting uses to create
outcomes, which could be considered artistic. Algorithmic layering is encouraged
at each turn!

In some sense, this more "bottom-up" approach to creation is maybe alien to
some, but the lack of explicit aesthetic or conceptual/artistic goals
has the potential to produce a much wider scope of outcomes (hopefully not only
visual - audio, text and other outputs are highly encouraged!). There's also
hope it _could_ be more educational, helping people to engage with a larger
repertoire of fundamental algorithmic tools and then apply & mix them in their
own work/practice.

Many of the topics & algorithms selected here will have a more or less known
visual representation and we encourage everyone to consciously reject these
clichés and make honest attempts to find creative other solutions to
visualize/sonify/represent them.

## Required skills

This is not a curriculum and should not be seen as a form of courseware. There're also no specific requirements or languages. Practically though, you should already feel (quite) familiar with your chosen language or toolset, so that your focus can be on the creative exploration of the prompts, rather than struggling along with syntax & fundamental semantics.

## (Very incomplete) List of topics

These will still have to be properly selected, ordered and turned into actual
daily prompts with linked references/materials. In no particular order or
importance (yet)! **The current list is very early WIP, more of a brain dump**
and has a large thematic overlap with a courseware I'm currently preparing for
various [thi.ng/umbrella](https://thi.ng/umbrella) packages. Feel free to

## Prompts

For each prompt we will try to provide a list of references, tutorial links, and
where applicable, images/diagrams/videos, (pseudo)code examples.

TODO - to be extracted & ordered from above topics
